/*

A CSS reset file is a stylesheet that serves as starting point for styling in a given project
by defining global styles for HTML elements and, in some cases, overriding the global styles
that browsers assign.

This file is Eric Meyer's famous "reset.css" stylesheet, which nukes most of the default styles
without adding anything of its own. It's recommended to customize this stylesheet to your liking, 
but I typically leave it alone and add any other globalstyle changes I want to make to my 
base-level SCSS file instead.

There are lots of different available reset stylesheets on the web now, but the two most
popular ones are still reset.css and normalize.css (a more opinionated version).
